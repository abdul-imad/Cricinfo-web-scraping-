#Web Scraping ESPNCricinfo website

This project does web sraping of all ipl matches and gives data of all teams winning 1 v 1 matches 
and it also gets data of total runs scored by the batsmen in entire IPL season

This project is done on command line. It uses 'Request' npm module for requesting data from a given URL
and 'Cheerio' module for web scraping.
